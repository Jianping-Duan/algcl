Algorithms and data structures are implements in C language.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project includes most commonly used computer algorithms and data
structures. The project has been tested on the FreeBSD 64-bit platform, Rocky
Linux 64-bit platform and Cygwin 64-bit platform. The Makefile in the project is
BSD-style, if you want to compile on some GNU/Linux platform and Cygwin
platform, you may need to modify the Makefile.
